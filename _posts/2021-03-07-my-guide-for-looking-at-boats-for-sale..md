**Pre-Owned 2000 Buying Tips**

My article about building a fleet refers to this checklist that I provide to my club sailors when they are looking to buy a 2K and join in our fun. 

Other than the obvious wear and tear on sails, hull and foils. Things to look out for.

Hairline cracks on any of the following:

1\. Around the pintles on the Stern.

2\. Where the shrouds connect to the hull.

3\. The hole where the bow sprit extends from the bow.

4\. Also look down the centreboard slot for any cracks/damage.

5\. Difficult to check when the boat is on the trolley but if you can, the condition of the centreboard.

Sails:

1\. Luff/bolt rope damage on the mainsail.

2\. Condition of batten pockets on mainsail.

3\. Whether the main is made of Mylar (best) or the cheaper Dacron.

4\. Condition of Jib on 2K is as important as the condition of the main.

5\. The spinnaker is light and therefore reasonably fragile, make sure you get it out the bag and give it a good check all over.

The classic place for damage to the hull is on the bow where it can hit the trolley when being loaded. A fairly easy repair if not already repaired!

The less obvious place is on the underside of the hull at the transom where the boat can easily be dragged therefore rubbing through the gel coat, again an easy repair with time and patience.

Check the Jib furling mechanism in the bow of the boat is working as it is expensive to replace.

Check the bow sprit is straight and runs freely.

If the main and spinnaker blocks have ratchets, check they are working by running the sheet through them and putting “load” on them.

Check condition of small blocks at base of mast and on the boom.

Make sure mast foot track is straight. If it’s twisted it could mean the boat has been de-masted at some point.

Get under the boat and check condition of the hull and that the slot gasket is intact.

Open the small hatch at the rear of the boat and tip the stern down then look for signs of water inside the hull.

Lastly boat’s with a yellow hull were built for training schools and are supposedly “beefed” up and therefore heavier.

All of the above issues are sortable/replaceable but if the boat has a lot of them it might well mean it has had a rough life.
