Inland venue in Kent with easy launching and close racing area. Very friendly club with a large home fleet and good racing guaranteed.

4th March 2021: 

We are sad to have to cancel our first Millennium Series event for 2021 (sponsored by West Country Boat Repairs), due to the date falling outside the Government's lockdown roadmap.

We look forward to enjoying the other series events as restrictions are eased, and will be considering possible additional dates.
