Sorry ! The Rutland RS Sprints event has been cancelled by Rutland SC. 

Large professionally run club in the Midlands with a huge amount of water space available. This event is part of the RS sprints, and will therefore be combined with other RS classes. Book accommodation early and prepare for a big event.
