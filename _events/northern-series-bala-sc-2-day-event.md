16th March update :: Please note this event has been postponed and will now happen on 10 - 11 JULY, on the request of Bala SC due to covid uncertainty. 

2 day event that is part of the Great British Sailing Challenge Series.

Saturday - Mass handicap start Long Distance Race the full 4 miles length of the lake. Usually windward leeward so suit Asymmetrics.

Sunday - 3 handicap races back to back, split into fleets depending on numbers. Turnout was around 60 boats in 2019, so a nice busy event.
